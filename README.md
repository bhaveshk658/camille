A command line program for Camille mains. It started as a project to learn Go but ended up being pretty useful.

## Example

## How it Works
This command-line program scrapes matchup webpages for winrates regarding the matchup using Go. Then, it uses Sheets API to retrieve
data from existing matchup spreadsheets and compiles them, providing all necessary matchup information into the terminal window. Then,
Riot Games' API is used to get recent match data to provide even more information.
